# Email Spam Filtering using Naive Credal Classifiers

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code and documentation for my dissertation project on email spam filtering using Naive Credal Classifiers. This project aims to explore advanced techniques in spam detection and provide a robust solution to email spam.

#Project Overview
The project employs Naive Credal Classifiers, a sophisticated approach in machine learning, to effectively distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. This technique is chosen for its ability to handle uncertainty and provide more reliable classifications in ambiguous situations, which are common in spam detection.


## Setup and Installation
To set up this project, follow these instructions:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zaccheus-lines/SpamCredalClassifier

# Navigate to the project directory
cd SpamCredalClassifier

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To run the spam filter, use the following command:

```bash
python spam_filter.py --input your-email-data-file
```

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available email dataset, which contains a mix of spam and non-spam emails. The dataset has been preprocessed to suit the requirements of Naive Credal Classifiers.

## Methodology
The project utilises Naive Credal Classifiers for spam detection. This method extends traditional probability-based classifiers by allowing for imprecise probabilities, making it more suitable for real-world applications where data may be incomplete or uncertain.
